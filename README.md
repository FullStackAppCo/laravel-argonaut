## Why?
You wanted to store some site preferences without the fiddle-faff and overkill of creating a Model and storing them in the database.

You don't want the preferences to be transferred from one site to another when you do a database dump. It's not everyone's use-case but sometimes you might prefer it.

You want to leverage the hierarchical nature of JSON to group values stored.

My use case was theme and sitewide settings.
